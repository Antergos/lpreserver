.It \fBhelp\fR 
Help for the specified command.
.It \fBcronsnap <dataset> <action> <frequency> <numToKeep>\fR
Schedule snapshot creation via cron
.br 
<action> can be start / stop
.br
.br
<frequeny> can be auto / daily@XX / hourly / 30min / 10min / 5min
         XX is the hour at which it should execute
When set to auto the following will take place:
    * Snapshots will be created every 5 minutes and kept for
      an hour.
    * A hourly snapshot will be kept for a day.
    * A daily snapshot will be kept for a month.
    * A Monthly snapshot will be kept for a year.
    * The life-preserver daemon will also keep track of the 
      zpool disk space,
      if the capacity falls below 75%, the oldest snapshot 
      will be auto-pruned.
.br
.br
<numToKeep> is the total number of snapshots to keep
.It \fBcronscrub <dataset> <action> <frequency>\fR
Schedule scrub via cron
.br
     <action> can be start or stop
.br
     <frequency> can be daily@XX / weekly@YY@XX monthly@ZZ@XX
                Where XX is the hour to execute

  recursive <on|off>

.It \fBstatus\fR

.br
        attach <zpool> <new disk>- Attach a new zpool disk
.br
               When a drive is first attached to a zpool, it 
               will be re-formatted with a new gpart layout 
               and made bootable with GRUB. For this reason 
               the disk must be the same size, or larger, 
               than the first array disk SWAP + ZFS
               partition size.
.br
        detach <zpool> <disk>- Remove a zpool disk
.br
        offline <zpool> <disk>- Mark a disk as offline
